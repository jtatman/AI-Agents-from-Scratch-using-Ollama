## Overview

The **Multi-Agent AI App with Ollama** is a Python-based application leveraging the open-source LLaMA 3.2:3b model via Ollama to perform specialized tasks through a collaborative multi-agent architecture. Built with Streamlit for an intuitive web interface, this system includes agents for summarizing medical texts, writing research articles, and sanitizing medical data (Protected Health Information - PHI). Each primary agent is paired with a corresponding validator agent to ensure the quality and accuracy of the outputs.

## Features

- **Summarize Medical Texts:** Generate concise summaries of lengthy medical documents.
- **Write and Refine Research Articles:** Create detailed research articles based on a given topic and optional outline, followed by refinement for enhanced quality.
- **Sanitize Medical Data (PHI):** Remove sensitive health information from medical datasets to ensure privacy compliance.
- **Quality Validation:** Each primary task is accompanied by a validator agent to assess and ensure output quality.
- **Robust Logging:** Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging purposes.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Streamlit-based web app for easy interaction and task management.
